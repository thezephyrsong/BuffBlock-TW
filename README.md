# BuffBlock #
**What is BuffBlock?**

BuffBlock removes selected beneficial buffs from the context menu as soon as they are applied.
This also has the added advantage of preventing the Tank from reaching the beneficial buff limit (32).

**Turtle WoW changes**

Added each tanking class (Warrior/Druid/Paladin/Shaman)'s auto salvation and hand of protection removal tool.

The original author of this addon is Armilus who published it at https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=19234

My efforts here have been to maintain the addon for use in raiding in Vanilla WoW and to provide fixes where required.

**Usage**

Use /sbb or /buffblock in-game to access the context menu to enable/disable beneficial buff blocking.

**Buff Options**  
- Battle Shout
- Blessing of Salvation
- Greater Blessing of Salvation
- Divine Spirit
- Prayer of Spirit
- Arcane Intellect
- Arcane Brilliance
- Blessing of Protection
- Divine Shield
- Blessing of Wisdom
- Greater Blessing of Wisdom
- Blessing of Sanctuary
- Greater Blessing of Sanctuary
- Great Blessing of Light (BoL shares a texture with Greated Arcane Proctection which would be an issue)

**Notes**

Smart Tank Buff Blocking: Salvation and Hand of Protection auto removal for each class
- Warrior: Either with shield equipped and/or defensive stance
- Druid: Bear or Dire Bear Form
- Paladin: Righteous Fury Active
- Shaman: with Rockbiter Weapon enchanted

**How It Works**

BuffBlock listens to the `PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED` event, which fires every time a buff or debuff is applied, removed, or refreshed on your character. When triggered, it scans your current buffs and immediately cancels any that you've selected to block.
